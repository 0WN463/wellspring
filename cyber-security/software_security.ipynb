    "From the above cases, we have seen that many issues stems from unexpected input being passed into the program.\n",

    "However, as discussed previously, it is difficult to ensure that filtering do not omit any malicious payloads.\n",
    "Hence, a filter that blocks all bad inputs while accepting all legitimate input is difficult to design.\n",

    "* White list\n",
    "    * Certain inputs are considered \"safe\".\n",
    "    Thus, we only allow these safe inputs and rejecting all others\n",
    "    * Some legitimate inputs may be rejected\n",
    "    Thus, there are 2 general approaches to filtering:\n",
    "* Black list\n",
    "    * Certain inputs are considered \"dangerous\" (*eg* \"./*\\\\$').\n",
    "    Thus, we reject these dangerous inputs and accept the rest.\n",
    "    * Some malicious inputs may be accepted"
