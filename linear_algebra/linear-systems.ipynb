    "Suppose we were given the following linear equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x + y = 4\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that (0,4) is a solution and so is (2,2) and (4,0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, if we find all possible solutions, they would fall in a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose instead we have\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that (0,0,4) is a solution and so is (0,2,2) and (0,4,0).\n",
    "However, so is (4,0,0), (1,1,2) and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting all of these will reveal that they fall in a plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in general, an equation with n variable will have solutions that fall in a n-dimensional hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Augmented Matrix\n",
    "Now suppose that instead, we have a system of linear equations\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x + y + z = 4 \\\\\n",
    "x + 2y + z = 5 \\\\\n",
    "4x + y + 2z = 2 \\\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is more convenient to view this as a matrix, since each variable term is the same for each equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we get \n",

    "## Elementary Row Operations\n",
    "Suppose we were given \n",

    "$$\n",

    "### Multiplying by a scalar\n",
    "Notice that for possible solutions $x + y = 4$, $2x + 2y = 8$ will results in the same solutions.\n",
    "Indeed, for any $k \\neq 0, kx + ky = 4k$ still produces the same solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we obtain our first elementary row operation, for any row $R_i$, we can replace it with $kR_i$ and still retain the same solution set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Swapping rows\n",
    "It is trivial to see that swapping of rows will not change the solution set.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "x + y = 4 & \\quad &x - y = 2 \\\\\n",
    "x - y = 2 & \\quad &x + y = 4 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2 linear systems above obviously have the same solution set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our second elementary row operation would be, for any two row $R_i, R_j$, we can swap the position of those rows in our matrix. $R_i \\leftrightarrow R_j$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding/Subtracting Row\n",
    "Suppose that we know that $x+y=4$ and $x-y=2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can sum the two equations together on both sides, getting $x+y+x-y=4+2 \\Rightarrow 2x + 0y = 6$\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution set will not change because we are simply summing equalities on both sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "And it is the same for subtraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our last elementary row operation is that we can replace any row $R_i$ with $R_i \\pm R_j$ for some other row $R_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Row Equivalence\n",
    "Since elementary row operations retain the solution set, if we can derive $\\vec B$ from $\\vec A$ via a series of elementary row operations, then the 2 systems must have the same solution set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Row-echelon form\n",
    "However, it may not always be easy to find the series of operations that can modify $\\vec A$ to $\\vec B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for each matrix, we try to change them into row-echelon form.\n"
