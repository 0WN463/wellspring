# Wellspring

Wellspring is a project to archive all the knowledge that I have acquired during my academic pursuit.
Note that it is displayed much better on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/0WN463/wellspring/tree/main/) rather than on GitHub.

## Goal
To archive the knowledge such that:
* it is easily accessible and shareable
* explanations are demonstrated in an interactive fashion, through the use of Jupyter notebooks.

## Progress
### Completed
1. neural-network
2. fuzzy-system
3. cyber-security
4. statistic
5. graph-theory

### Some minor tweaks required
1. algorithm analysis
2. ai

### WIP
1. computer-networks
2. computer-vision
3. discrete-structures
4. natural-language-processing
