# Wellspring

Wellspring is a project to archive all the knowledge that I have acquired during my academic pursuit.
Note that it is displayed much better on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/0WN463/wellspring/tree/main/) rather than on GitHub.

## Goal
To archive the knowledge such that:
* it is easily accessible and shareable
* explanations are demonstrated in an interactive fashion, through the use of Jupyter notebooks.

## Progress
### Completed
1. neural_network
2. fuzzy_system
3. cyber_security
4. statistic
5. graph_theory
6. signal_processing
7. real_time_systems
8. linear_algebra

### Some minor tweaks required
1. algorithm analysis
2. ai

### WIP
1. computer_networks
2. computer_vision
3. discrete_structures
4. natural_language_processing
5. linear_optimization

## Future modules
2. Multivariable differential equations
3. Basic circuitry

## Contribution

Feel free to create issues (or even PR's) for any typos, improvements, or even if you have any doubts about the subject matter (though the frequency of addressing issues may vary).
