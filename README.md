# Wellspring

Wellspring is a project to archive all the knowledge that I have acquired during my academic pursuit.
Note that it is displayed much better on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/0WN463/wellspring/tree/main/) rather than on GitHub.

## Goal
To archive the knowledge such that:
* it is easily accessible and shareable
* explanations are demonstrated in an interactive fashion, through the use of Jupyter notebooks.

## Acknowledgement
All information produced in this repository are adapted from various modules provided by National University of Singapore.
