    "**Given a start state and goal state, find the optimal sequence of actions to take so that the agent reaches the goal state.**\n",

    "Frequently, we would want the sequence of action to be optimal, which means to say that it is the least cost/highest utility sequence of action that reaches the goal state.\n"

    "* The actions that can be generated from this node\n",
    "* The path cost of each action\n",

The possible positions that the robot can take would be infinite, since its coodinates can take any real number. Thus, the analysis of the algorithm will be slightly different from those in the [Algorithm Analysis](../algorithm-analysis/graph_algorithms.ipynb#traversal)."
