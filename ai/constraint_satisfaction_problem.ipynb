    "# Constraint Satisfaction Problems\n",
    "A CSP is defined as a problem where the AI is tasked to find a set of values for each of the variable such that it satisfy all the constraints given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, there are the following parameters:\n",
    "* Variables: $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$\n",
    "* Domain of variables: $D_i$. This represents the range of values a given variable can take.\n",
    "* Constraints: $C_i$. Constraints can be relating one or multiple variables together.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common way to solve CSP's is with [backtrack search](#backtrack-search), which we will discuss in the case study.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case Study: N-queens\n",
    "A classic problem is the N-queens problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is simply define as finding a placement for n queens on a $n \\times n$ chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when n = 4, the following is one possible placement\n",

    "### Naive Approach\n",
    "A naive approach is to simply iterate through all possible locations for the 4 queens and find those that are valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, even for such a small board, there are $C^{16}_4 = 1820$ combinations to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "A smarter approach is to notice that no two queens can be on the same column, so we can iterate all the possible rows for the queen at a particular column.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings our search down to $4^4 = 256$ states."

    "Thus, we can \"prune\" any configuration that arises from this sub-state.\n",

    "* $Q_3: 2 \\times 4 = 8$, no valid children for $Q_2 = 3$, 1 for $Q_2 = 4$\n",
    "* $Q_4: 1 \\times 4 = 4$, none of which are valid.\n",
