    "\n",
    "Suppose the character is different, then in the case of insertion, we need to insert B[m] at the back of A, thus we need a total of dist(A[1:n], B[1:m-1]) + 1 edits, because the last character in B is matched by the new insertion, and the +1 is the cost of the insertion.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Deletion will compare `lume` to `almond`, where the `n` is deleted and we now solve the subproblem of `lume` to `almond`\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, for substitution, we would need to swap out the last character of A with the last character of B, which means we need a total of dist(A[1:n-1], B[1:m-1]) + 1 edits, since both A and B will have one last character to match.\n",
    "\n",
