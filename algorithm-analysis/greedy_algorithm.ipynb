    "# Greedy Algorithm\n",
    "Remember that in [dynamic programming](./dynamic_programming.ipynb), we have to traverse a tree to find our desired solution.\n",
    "We compare the results from branches of a node in an attempt to find the solution.\n",
    "What if we somehow knew which branch would lead to the correct solution?\n",
    "It could greatly improve our time complexity of our algorithm.\n",
    "This is the so called **greedy algorithm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, whether we can solve a problem greedily greatly depends on the nature of the problem.\n",

    "1. Consider the solution $G$ that our (greedy) algorithm produce\n",
    "2. We need to prove that $f(G) = f(O)$\n",
    "3. For any solution $O$, show that we can slowly change it to obtain $G$, without increasing $f$ at any step.\n",
