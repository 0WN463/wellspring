    "Now suppose we have a multigraph $G$ with $2k$ odd vertices.\n",
    "Consider any connected component in the graph which contains an odd vertex.\n",
    "By handshaking lemma, there must at least 2 odd vertices in $G$.\n",
    "Thus, we can create a $u-v$ path $P$ within this component.\n",
    "Then, notice that $G - E(P)$ contains $k-1$ edge-disjoint paths as per above requirement, by the induction hypothesis.\n",
