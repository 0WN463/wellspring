    "Suppose $G$ is bipartite.\n",
    "Assume that $G$ contains an odd cycle of size $k$, $v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_k = v_0$ where $k$ is odd.\n",
    "Without loss of generality, suppose that the partition assigns $v_0$ to $V_1$.\n",
    "This means that $v_1$ must be in $V_2$, and in general, $v_i$ is in $V_1$ if $i$ is even, $V_2$ otherwise.\n",
    "However, consider $v_{k-1}$. \n",
    "It must be even, thus it must belong to $V_1$.\n",
    "However, it is also adjacent to $v_k = v_0$, which belongs to $V_1$ also, which violates the definition of a partition.\n",
    "Hence, $G$ does not contain an odd cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that $G$ contains no odd cycle.\n",
    "Since $G$ is bipartite if and only if its components are bipartite, we can assume that $G$ is connected.\n",
    "We select any vertex $x$ in $G$ and for every other vertex $v$, we put it in the partition $V_1$ if $d(x, v)$ is even, otherwise in $V_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will prove that this is a valid partition.\n",
    "Suppose that there exists an edge joining $u,v$ for $u,v \\in V_1$.\n",
    "Looking at the minimum $x-u$ and $v-x$ path, we notice that since $u,v$ are in the same partition, they must have the same parity.\n",
    "Thus, the $x-u-v-x$ closed walk must be odd.\n",
    "By the previous lemma, this means that there exists some odd cycle, which contradicts our assumption.\n",
    "Hence, there will not be an edge between two vertices of the same partition and thus the partition must be valid. $QED$\n",
