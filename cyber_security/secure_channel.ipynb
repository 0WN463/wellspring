    "# Strong authentication\n",
    "A authentication system is known to be \"weak\" when an attacker who can obtain the password and replay it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a typical password system is weak, because anyone who has access to the channel can view the password sent by the sender, and use the same credentials to authenticate with the receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example of strong authentication is the **challenge-response** system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shared-key cryptography challenge-response\n",
    "Suppose that both sender and receiver shares some secret key $k$.\n",
    "Then the following process is performed for authentication\n",
    "1. Alice requests communication with Bob\n",
    "2. Bob randomly decides on a message $m$\n",
    "3. Bob sends Alice the ciphertext $y = E_k(m)$\n",
    "4. Alice decrypts the ciphertext and replies Bob with $m' = D_k(y)$\n",
    "5. Bob verifies that $m'=m$, which is evidence that Alice knows the secret key $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in this case, even if the attacker has full control over the channel, they cannot derive the secret key $k$ which was never sent through the channel directly.\n",
    "And since $m$ is chosen randomly at the start of any communication, the attacker is also unable to use the $m$ or $m'$ they obtain to request a separate connection with the receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Public-key cryptography challenge-response\n",
    "Similarly, we can perform the challenge-response in a public-key cryptography setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following process is performed for authentication\n",
    "1. Alice requests communication with Bob\n",
    "2. Bob randomly decides on a number $r$ and sends it to Alice\n",
    "3. Alice signs $r$ and sends her signature and her certificate to Bob\n",
    "4. Bob verifies the authenticity of Alice's certificate, then obtain Alice's public key from it\n",
    "5. Bob verifies that the signature on $r$ using her public key\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above cases, $r$ is known as **nonces**, a number that is used only once during communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insufficiency of strong authentication\n",
    "Suppose that the receiver has indeed authenticated that the one sending the message through the channel is a legitimate sender.\n",
    "However, consider the case when an attacker is able to hijack the channel at any point in time.\n",
    "This means that they can impersonate as the sender after the authentication by the receiver, thus nullifying the authentication performed at the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, strong authentication system, on its own, is unable to the secure the channel.\n",
    "Therefore, to secure the channel in an event that the attacker can compromise the channel after authentication, the communicating parties must share some form of secret key."

    "1. Alice generates a public-private key pair\n",
    "2. Alice sends her public key to Bob\n",
    "3. Bob randomly decides on a session key $k$\n",
    "4. Bob encrypts $k$ with Alice's public key, and sends it over to Alice\n",
    "5. Alice decrypts $k$ using her private key\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, the attacker can only see the encrypted session key on the channel.\n",
    "Since the attacker is unable to derive the session key without Alice's private key, the session is only known the Alice and Bob at the end of the exchange, as desired.\n",
