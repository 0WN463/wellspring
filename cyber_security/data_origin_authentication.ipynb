    "Digital signature is simply the asymmetric version of MAC.\n",
    "Thus, the sender will sign the message using his secret key.\n",
    "And **anyone** can verify that the message is indeed from the sender by using the public key.\n",
    "Note that digest sent to the receiver is computed using the **secret key**, unlike in RSA where the sent message is encrypted using the **public key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using similar arguments as RSA, the message can only be signed by someone who knows the corresponding private key of the public key.\n",
    "Thus, signature scheme also achieves **non-repudiation**, where the signing entity cannot deny the his previous action/message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that non-repudiation is not achieved using MAC only.\n",
    "Since MAC is symmetric, both sender and receiver has know about the secret key.\n",

    "#### Birthday attacks\n",
    "Note that if collisions can be easily generated, the hashing function no longer guarantee integrity, because it will not be able to discern the difference between the two collided data.\n",
    "Thus, attackers will aim to find collisions as a method to violate the integrity of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the \"Birthday Paradox\" which states that it only requires 23 people such that the probability that two of them shares the same birthday is >50%.\n",
    "This phenomenon appears because the pairwise comparisons between people's birthdays grows quadratically with respect to the number of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, suppose that our hash can only appear as 366 different values.\n",
    "Then the attacker only needs to generate the hashes of 23 different messages to have a more than even chance of producing a collision.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, if the hash space is $T$, if an attacker generates $M$ messages such that \n",

    "M > 1.17T^{0.5}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "then he has a probability of greater than 0.5 to find a collision.\n",
