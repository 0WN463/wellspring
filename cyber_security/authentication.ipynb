    "# Authentication\n",
    "Authentication is the process of assuring that the communicating entity/origin of information is what they claim to be\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of authentications:\n",
    "* Entity authentication:\n",
    "    * for connection-based communication\n",
    "    * assuring the identity of the communicating entity\n",
    "    * eg. password, challenge + response, biometrics\n",
    "* Data-origin authentication\n",
    "    * for connectionless communication\n",
    "    * assuring the identity of the origin of information\n",
    "    * eg. MAC, digital signature\n",
    "    \n",
    "An entity/origin is **authentic** when their identity is assured by some supporting evidence.\n",
    "Thus, authenticity is the condition of being authentic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Authenticity and Integrity\n",
    "Note that authenticity is related to integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a message that is modified mid-transit (ie integrity is violated), then clearly the message can no longer be authentic since it does not belong to the author.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can say that $\\lnot I \\rightarrow \\lnot A$, or by contrapositive, $A \\rightarrow I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, if a message is authentic, then its integrity is upheld.\n",
    "In other words, authenticity is a stronger condition than integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "The issue of authenticity appears in various situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entity\n",
    "Suppose I wish to login to a banking system, how does the banking system knows that I am who I claim to be?\n",
    "\n",
    "Or even when searching for wireless access points, how do we truly know that the access point really is \"Starbucks\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Origin\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a contract is signed by someone, how do we know that the signature is authentic, or the terms of the contract was not modified after signing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Or that you receive a mail which claims to be from the bank.\n",
    "How do we ensure that the sender really is from the bank?"

    "\n",
    "### Process\n",

    "* Server establishes a password with each user.\n",
    "* Server keeps a record of the identity (eg userid, username) and the corresponding password\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping can be done by either:\n",
    "* Server sets a password and sends it to the user via some communication medium, or vice versa.\n",
    "* Server sets a default password for the user\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stage 2: Authentication\n",
    "* Server authenticates the entity\n",
    "* If the entity provides the correct password corresponding to the claimed identity, the entity is deemed authentic.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical interaction involves:\n",
    "1. user identifying themselves\n",
    "2. server giving a password challenge\n",
    "3. user replies with the password\n",
    "4. server authenticates the user, authorizing them to perform actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, authentication can be performed without interaction.\n",
    "For example, the user simply sends their identifier, their password and their desired action to the server, to which the server will process on their side."
