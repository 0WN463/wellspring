Note that the goal of this chapter is ultimately to be able to perform hypothesis testing.
Thus, 
* The first 4 chapters lays the foundation about random variables.
* Chapter 5 builds on top of random variables, expanding into probability distribution.
* Chapter 6 describes the characteristics of a sample from a probability distribution.
* Chapter 7 gives us a way of estimating the population parameters from a sample.
* Chatper 8 uses the estimation to determine the validity of some claims.
